General Results.  (From the specific Fraction experiments. This data was copied from Slack messages and other text
files and documented here.)
There were two main images; One with various colored cars stopped at a stop light and a seond with 3 road signs on the 
side of a highway.  Both images were found through Google Searches and downloaded for the experiment. 
1. Cars: 4 users submitted data, 1 tried to get the money anyway
2. Signs: 4 Users seemed to have tried; One put in random stuff (actually seemed to be an incremental counter) until the answer appeared.
3. Signs: One person out of 8 opened the directions. (Signs)
3. Cars much easier than Signs based upon the number of questions where we had to show the answer;
    Cars -- 10 questions / 34.

 4. Based upon the abvoe, mTurkers have no clue how to estimate given a scale and a known value. They are pretty poor at estimating percentage covered as well.  Probably more examples and hints to help. 

 5. Most helpful comment from the survey came from the guy who got it.  One person seemed to be doing a completely different activity or had a bot fill things out.
 Helpful comment:
 "I think this activity was meant to show how fractions could be useful in everyday life. Something to do with spatial awareness as well.""	
 "Some of the later questions weren't quite as clear as those in the beginning. That being said, I never truly found the questions difficult to answer. More challenging in a way I suppose. I think things were better when the answers were more object and not subjective."
 Confusing comment:
 "Students shuffle the cards and place them face down. Each student chooses two cards and places them with the smaller card for the numerator and the larger card"
